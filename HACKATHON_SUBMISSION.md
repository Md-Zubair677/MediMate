### **Key Technical Implementations**

#### **AI-Powered Chat System**
```python
# Bedrock integration for medical consultations
async def get_medical_consultation(symptoms: List[str], patient_data: Dict):
    prompt = f"""
    Medical Consultation Request:
    Symptoms: {', '.join(symptoms)}
    Patient Data: {patient_data}
    
    Provide structured medical guidance with:
    1. Preliminary assessment
    2. Recommended actions
    3. When to seek immediate care
    4. Confidence level
    """
    
    response = await bedrock_client.invoke_model(
        modelId="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
        body=json.dumps({
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            "max_tokens": 1000
        })
    )
    return response
```

#### **Multi-Step Appointment Booking**
```python
# Session-managed booking flow
async def process_booking_step(session_id: str, step_data: Dict):
    session = await get_booking_session(session_id)
    
    # Validate and store step data
    if step_data.get('step') == 'patient_info':
        session['patient_name'] = step_data['name']
        session['patient_phone'] = step_data['phone']
        session['patient_email'] = step_data['email']
    elif step_data.get('step') == 'symptoms':
        session['symptoms'] = step_data['symptoms']
    
    await save_booking_session(session_id, session)
    return {"status": "success", "next_step": get_next_step(session)}
```

#### **ML Health Risk Prediction**
```python
# Health risk assessment with confidence scoring
async def predict_health_risk(patient_data: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Extract features
    features = {
        'age': patient_data.get('age', 0),
        'symptoms': len(patient_data.get('symptoms', [])),
        'vital_signs': patient_data.get('vitals', {}),
        'medical_history': len(patient_data.get('history', []))
    }
    
    # Calculate risk score
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(features)
    
    return {
        'risk_score': risk_score,
        'risk_level': 'high' if risk_score > 0.7 else 'medium' if risk_score > 0.4 else 'low',
        'confidence': 0.95 if 'chest pain' in patient_data.get('symptoms', []) else 0.85,
        'recommendations': generate_recommendations(risk_score)
    }
```

### **Database Design**
We implemented a hybrid approach with DynamoDB for scalability and session storage for booking flows:

```python
# Patient data structure
patient_schema = {
    'patient_id': 'string',
    'personal_info': {
        'name': 'string',
        'email': 'string',
        'phone': 'string',
        'date_of_birth': 'string'
    },
    'medical_data': {
        'symptoms': ['array'],
        'medical_history': ['array'],
        'medications': ['array']
    },
    'appointments': ['array'],
    'created_at': 'timestamp'
}
```

    try:
        decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, algorithms=['RS256'])
        
        return {
            'user_id': decoded_token['sub'],
            'role': decoded_token.get('custom:role', 'patient'),
            'verified': True
        }

                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
